# Image processing app

I've done this project as a technical assessment for a job interview. In the interview I couldn't complete it, I barely started on it, as I didn't prepare in Node.js, and I was shocked. I completed the task at home on my own pace, but it took me more than an hour.

Still need to sort out one thing: when I save the output, it saves as the same file type, this should be changed to jpeg with a 90% quality. Initially, it saves in the same file type, but in this case, I can't specify the quality.

## 1.0.1

- Changes all output file extension to .jpeg
- Output file quality is set to 90%
- recursive function fixed
