# Image processing app

I was asked to complete a very similar assessment within an interview setting but unlike to complete it, since then I took some time to understand and learn how to compress images without losing quality in Node.js.
 
Whilst freelancing I acquired a very similar project to resize images for a company that had a WordPress online website and needed to resize all images.

## 1.0.1

- Changes all output file extension to .jpeg
- Output file quality is set to 90%
- recursive function fixed
